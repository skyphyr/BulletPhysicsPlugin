## Status Experimental, but somewhat useable.
#### Please make your own fork if you decide to use this.

Implementing and adding support for a custom USkeletalMeshComponent. It supports compound shapes.

*This is a work in progress (very WIP) :), use the originally forked repo mentioned below if you want something usable.*

## How to use

### Windows
Clone this repo into a `Plugin` directory of your choice, `Engine` or `<Your project Dir>`.

### Linux
Clone this repo into a `Plugin` directory of your choice, `Engine` or `<Your project Dir>`.

### Mac
Might work, no idea

#### Manual compilation (bullet 3) 
*You don't need to do this. Just putting it here if you need to compile it*
1. Clone [bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3)
2. Compile,

```bash
cmake \
    -DLIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH=<PATH TO THIS REPO>/BulletPhysicsPlugin/Source/ThirdParty/BulletPhysicsEngineLibrary/lib/linux/<RelFolder>\
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 \
    -DINSTALL_LIBS=0 \
    -DINSTALL_EXTRA_LIBS=0 \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<RelType> \ # Replace build type as required: `Debug`,`RelWithDebugInfo`,`Release`.
    .
```

3. `make`, had to use `make -j` because, compile was not using all cores for some reason.
